Step by Step Condition
Sometimes, the normal if-else isn't enough. In such cases, we have what we call ladder if and else conditions.  So here we'll learn to use them.

Given a positive integer N. Your task is to check if it divisible as given below:
1. If it is divisible by 2, print "Two".
2. If it is divisible by 3, print "Three".
3. If it is divisible by 11, print "Eleven".
4. If not follow above three rules, print "-1".
Note: If N is divisible by more than one of the above given numbers, print the one which is largest.

Input Format:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcases, there will be a single line containing N.

Output Format:
For each testcase, check divisibility and print statements accordingly as given in above steps (without quotes).

Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function to check divisibility as required.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
3
11

Output:
Three
Eleven
