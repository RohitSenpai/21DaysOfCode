Sample Input

6
1 4 6 2 8 9
2
2 4
Sample Output

3
1 8 9
Explanation

The first query is to erase the 2nd element in the vector, which is 4. Then, modifed vector is {1 6 2 8 9}, we want to remove the range of 2~4, which means the 2nd and 3rd elements should be removed. Then 6 and 2 in the modified vector are removed and we finally get {1 8 9}
