Sample Input

2
5 2
3 4 6 3 4
7 4
3 4 5 8 1 4 10
Sample Output

4 6 6 4
8 8 8 10
Explanation

For the first case, the contiguous subarrays of size 2 are {3,4},{4,6},{6,3} and {3,4}. The 4 maximum elements of subarray of size 2 are: 4 6 6 4.

For the second case,the contiguous subarrays of size 4 are {3,4,5,8},{4,5,8,1},{5,8,1,4} and {8,1,4,10}. The 4 maximum element of subarray of size 4 are: 8 8 8 10.
