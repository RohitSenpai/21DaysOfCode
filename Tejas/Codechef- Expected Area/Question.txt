You are given a convex polygon P with vertices P0,P1,…,Pn−1, each having integer coordinates. On each edge PiP(i+1)%n of the polygon, choose a point Ri uniformly at random. What is the expected area of the convex hull of these n chosen points R0,R1,…Rn−1 ?

Note
Consider the area of the convex hull as zero if it contains less than 3 vertices.
All the points Ri are chosen independently of each other.
Your answer is considered correct if and only if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10−6.
Input
The first line contains n, the number of vertices in the convex polygon.
The next n lines contain the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in anti-clockwise order.
Output
For each testcase, print the expected area of the convex hull of the n randomly chosen points.

Constraints
3≤n≤105
The absolute values of all the coordinates ≤107.
All the points in the input are distinct.
The described polygon P is convex and the vertices of the polygon are given in anti-clockwise order. Also, no three vertices of the polygon are collinear.
